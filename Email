Dear GGG support,
 
  I am emailing today regarding a recent banning of two accounts (Mine and my brothers). We got banned for using a Zoomhack/Maphack.
  While I understand maintaining integrity of races and with real life or ingame rewards, if you check our accounts we were never
  close  or used to hacks to gain advantages in this respect. Infact for the three years we have been playing I have not obtained
  a single reward (other than getting a SC character to level 60 during some 1 month or 1 week).
  
  Infact while we enjoy POE, we had not even played in about 5 months...
  
  After being an avid fan for over 3 years, a permanent ban seems very harsh. While reading the experience of others and comments on
  reddit it seems you issued a warning regarding hacks, however I do not recall seeing one (I hadnt played or even logged on between
  a few days before awakening and mid-bloodlines league).
  
  Around the time i was taking a break from POE, a popular streamer Ghudda streamed a server instance crash and vaal skill gem exploit
  Using it to do some farming runs as well as crash instances. At that time GGG delivered a well measured response in giving him
  a temporary ban.
  
  I feel a permanent ban is too harsh a punishment for the given situation - using a hack in a semi-non competetive manner (races)
  While i agree it is impossible for GGG to measure impact and intent of every given ban, a review and/or appeal process atleast
  With first time offenders receiving a temporary ban is more appropriate.
  
  In conclusion a repsonse to the following questions would be appreciated no matter what the answer is.
  
  1. Can our accounts be unbanned?
  2. If no, can i create a new account and continue to play?
  2. If so, can our MTX/support packs (none of which are reward/competition based) be transfered to the new accounts?
  
  Thanks for taking the time to read.
  
  Sincerely,
  David
